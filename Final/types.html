              Sustained Energy: Snacks can help maintain steady blood sugar levels and provide a source of sustained energy throughout the day. Choosing snacks that combine carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats can help keep you feeling satisfied and prevent energy crashes.
              
              Increased Nutrient Intake: Snacks can contribute to a more varied and nutrient-rich diet. By selecting wholesome snack options, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, or yogurt, you can increase your intake of essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.
              
              Portion Control: Snacks can assist in portion control by preventing overeating during main meals. By incorporating nutritious snacks between meals, you are less likely to feel overly hungry and prone to overindulging during your next meal.</td>
